    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><small>Last updated: {{ last_updated or "January 1, 2026" }}</small></p>

    <p>
      This website is operated for the International Quarter Scale Competition (“we”, “us”, “our”).
      This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect information when you use this site.
    </p>

    <h2>Information we collect</h2>

    <h3>Analytics and usage data</h3>
    <p>
      We use Google Analytics to help us understand how visitors use this site, including which pages
      are visited, how long visitors stay, and what devices and browsers are used. Google Analytics
      collects information such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Pages and content you view</li>
      <li>Your approximate location (based on IP address)</li>
      <li>Device and browser information</li>
      <li>Referring website or link</li>
      <li>Session duration and general interaction with the site</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Google Analytics “Google Signals” and logged-in Google accounts</h3>
    <p>
      We have enabled certain Google Analytics features that allow Google to collect additional data
      from users who are signed in to their Google accounts and have turned on Ads Personalization.
      This is sometimes referred to as <strong>Google Signals</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      When these features are active, Google may associate your visit to this site with your Google
      account and combine this information with data from other sites that use Google services.
      Google then provides us with aggregated and anonymized reports, such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>More detailed demographics and interests reports</li>
      <li>Cross-device reporting (for example, when users visit from both mobile and desktop)</li>
      <li>Better understanding of how visitors return to and move through the site over time</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We only see this information in aggregated form and never receive your individual Google account
      information or identity from Google.
    </p>

    <h2>Cookies and similar technologies</h2>
    <p>
      Google Analytics uses cookies and similar technologies to collect and store analytics data.
      Cookies are small text files stored on your device by your browser.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can control or delete cookies through your browser settings. If you disable cookies,
      some features of this site may not work as intended, but basic browsing should still be possible.
    </p>

    <h2>How we use this information</h2>
    <p>We use the analytics information described above to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Understand how visitors find and use the site</li>
      <li>Monitor site performance and fix issues</li>
      <li>Improve layout, navigation, and content</li>
      <li>Plan and prioritize features related to events, teams, tractors, and results</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We do <strong>not</strong> sell your personal information, and we do not attempt to identify
      individual visitors from analytics data.
    </p>

    <h2>Google’s use of data</h2>
    <p>
      Google’s use of information collected through Google Analytics is governed by Google’s own
